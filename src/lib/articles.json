Clear and Specific Title</h3>\n<p>Your title should be specific and describe your problem concisely. Avoid vague titles like 'Help me' or 'This doesn't work'.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Good:</strong> 'How to iterate over a HashMap in Java 8?'</li><li><strong>Bad:</strong> 'Java problem help needed'</li></ul>\n<h3>2. Provide Context</h3>\n<p>Explain what you're trying to achieve and what you've already tried. This helps others understand your situation better.</p>\n<h3>3. Include Code Examples</h3>\n<p>If your question involves code, provide a minimal, complete, and verifiable example. This makes it easier for others to understand and reproduce your issue.</p>\n<h3>4. Show Your Research</h3>\n<p>Mention what you've already researched or attempted. This shows effort and prevents duplicate suggestions.</p>\n<h3>5. Use Proper Formatting</h3>\n<p>Use code blocks, bullet points, and proper formatting to make your question easy to read and understand.</p>\n<h3>6. Be Respectful</h3>\n<p>Remember that people are volunteering their time to help you. Be polite and grateful for any assistance you receive.</p>",

    "content": "<h2>Code Formatting Guide</h2>\n<p>Proper code formatting makes your questions and answers much easier to read and understand. Here's how to format code effectively on TechBlog.</p>\n<h3>Inline Code</h3>\n<p>For short snippets or variable names, use backticks:</p>\n<p><code>`console.log()`</code> renders as <code>console.log()</code></p>\n<h3>Code Blocks</h3>\n<p>For longer code snippets, use triple backticks with language specification:</p>\n<pre><code>```javascript\nfunction greet(name) {\n  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);\n}\n```</code></pre>\n<h3>Supported Languages</h3>\n<p>TechBlog supports syntax highlighting for many languages:</p>\n<ul><li>javascript, typescript, jsx, tsx</li><li>python, java, c, cpp, csharp</li><li>html, css, scss, less</li><li>sql, json, xml, yaml</li><li>bash, shell, powershell</li><li>And many more...</li></ul>\n<h3>Best Practices</h3>\n<ul><li>Always specify the language for syntax highlighting</li><li>Remove unnecessary whitespace and comments</li><li>Include only relevant code - create minimal examples</li><li>Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)</li><li>Add comments to explain complex logic</li></ul>\n<h3>Example Output</h3>\n<p>Here's how properly formatted code looks:</p>\n<pre><code>// Calculate factorial recursively\nfunction factorial(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return 1;\n  return n * factorial(n - 1);\n}\n\nconsole.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120</code></pre>",
